 * To decode FM, we convert the frequency deviation to phase and detect the phase change
 * We have the signal in phase and quadrature.  The amplitude of each of these correspond to the real and 
 * imaginary parts of the signal.  So, we can calculate the angle of the signal, theta using:
 *
 * tan(theta) = Q/I, theta = arctan (q/i)
 * 
 * 
 * The atan demodulator is based on code in SDR Trunk

	 * We pass in the current values for i and q

	 *  * To measure the change in frequency, we want d-theta/dt and we don't want to use arctan because its hard to do at speed.
	 *
	 * r(t) = q(t)/i(t)
	 *
	 * Derivative of arctan is the identity 1/(1+r^2)
	 * Therefore d-theta/dt = 1/(1+r^2)( d[r(t)/d(t) )   (1)
	 * Also, d[r(t)]/dt = d[q(t)/i(t)/d(t) and there is an identity for the derivative of a ratio, so
	 * d[r(t)/d(t) = ( i(t) * d[q(t)]/d(t) - q(t) * d[i(t)]/d(t) ) /i^2(t)
	 * 
	 * So, using this result in equation (1) above gives
	 * d-theta/d(t) = (1/(1 + r^2)(  ( i(t) * d[q(t)]/d(t) - q(t) * d[i(t)]/d(t) ) /i^2(t) )
	 * 
	 * Replacing r(t) with q(t)/i(t) gives:
	 * d-theta/d(t) = (1/(1 + (q(t)^2/i(t)^2)(  ( i(t) * d[q(t)]/d(t) - q(t) * d[i(t)]/d(t) ) /i^2(t) )
	 * 
	 * Multiply by i^2(t)
	 * d-theta/d(t) = i(t)d[q(t)]/d(t) - q(t)d[i(t)]/d(t) 
	 *                   ------------------------------------
	 *                           i^2(t) + q^2(t) 
	 *
	 * Using the central difference method for differentiation gives:
	 * d-theta(n) = i(n-1) * (q(n) - q(n-2)) - q(n-1) * (i(n) - i(n-2))
	 *                 -----------------------------------------------------------

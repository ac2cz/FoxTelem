 * The Header for the slow speed telemetry
 * 48 bits of data that store the header information for the slow speed telemetry frames
 * 
 * The satellite sends the data most significant bit first, but it is a little endian system
 * So we get the least significant byte first, but with its most significant bit received first.
 * 
 * To compensate we reverse the order of the received bytes when we store them in the bit array.
 * That means that the least significant bit of the least significant byte is stored first and 
 * the msb of the whole number is stored last.
 * When we read the value out of the array, we again read it backwards, starting with the highest
 * number in the array (which is the msb) and then down to the lowest number.  This is then converted 
 * to an int and stored in the field.
 * 
 * More detailed explanation follows, starting with the 10 bit SYNC word and then the 8 bit decoded words
 * that typically follow in the header
 *

Now in your 1-bit-per-array entry put it as follow

Array index   Value
0                    1     <- Least significant bit of first byte and of the FoxID
1                    0
2                    0     <- Most sig bit of Fox ID
3                    0 <- Least significant bit of reset count
4                    1
5                    1
6                    0
7                    1  <- Most significant bit of first byte

8                    1  <- Least significant bit of 2nd byte
9                    0
10                  0

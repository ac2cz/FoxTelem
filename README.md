Instructions on how to build are here: https://www.g0kla.com/foxtelem/build_foxtelem.php

I did them a while ago. Let me know if anything does not work and needs to be updated.

Feel free to ask questions if you need help. My main motivation is to help people learn about satellites, amateur radio, DSP and coding. So always happy to answer questions.
